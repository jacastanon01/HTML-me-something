            <p>My name is Jacob Castanon. I am currently enrolled in LaunchCode to sharpen my coding skills.
                My goal in this course is to start a career in and learn more about web development. This is my first 
                webpage I've created using HTML. In this page, I will detail my journey toward my decision to pursue interst in this career path.</p>

                        <p>I grauduated high school in 2011 and decided to go to Kansas State University. While attending college, 
                        I got a job at the university auditorium as an usher. As an usher, I got to attend all types of shows and school
                        musicals/ orchestras. I really enjoyed my time at K-State; However, I ended up dropping out
                        after my sophomore year.

                        <h4>Busser</h4>
                        <p>Upon coming back to Kansas City, I worked at Fogo de Chao bussing tables. Although that was a great place to work, I did not enjoy
                        the restaurant enviroment. Every weekend would be packed and very stressful. I struggled to maintain their fast pace, but sometimes it 
                        would be worth it because after every shift, we would enjoy a free meal.

                        <p>After realizing I was not fit for the restaurant industry, I decided to try my luck with manual labor. I applied for a job
                        as a junkman. I learned not to judge anything before you try it because it was one the better job experiences and it taught me a lot about
                        profressionalism and maintaining a good work ethic. I started out as a crew member and eventually moved up to crew leader
                        which enabled me to gain leadership skills. As a crew leader, I was allowed to control the pace of my route and lead.
                        The job was more than just a glorified trashman, it as much a sales position as it was general labor.
                        After working there for a nearly a year, we had cutbacks and I was off to another position.

                        <p>I began working at Barnes and Noble in the receiving/ shipping department. Once I got more comfortable
                        I began stocking in the front of the store. I enjoyed this job, it was very low-key.</p>

                        <p>I started out at the roasterie as a member of the bean team, where I would
                        go to events and give out free samples of coffee while engaging in conversation with potential customers.
                        Eventually, I was given an opportunity to work full-time as a delivery driver, delivering coffee
                        to various cafes, restaurants and businesses. As of now, I still work here. My job duites now vary
                        from delivering coffee on my route to helping out in shipping/ receiving and, more recently,
                        getting involved in making our cold brew and operating the canning line.

                    <h2>Future and Beyond!</h2>
                        
                    <p>I am interested in progressing my career into a new field. I've learned what I do not like in a job, and I feel 
                        a career in programming will provide an enviroment I enjoy. There are ample opportunities in technology and I've worked
                        enough jobs to know what I do not want to do. I am grateful for the experiences I have accumilated, but looking forward
                        I am hoping to get my foot in the door in something new. I know I do not like fast-pace stress-filled enviroments. Though
                        sometimes programming can be stressful, I view it more as a puzzle that stresses you out and less of an 
                        angry-coworker-yelling-at-you-for-being-slow type of stress. My past jobs have only motivated me to begin something new, 
                        no matter how difficult the journey may be. </p>
                    <p>
                        As of now, I only have experience with Python, HTML and CSS. I began messing around with html and css about a year ago, but I could never focus
                        enough to finish learning the basics. I found it difficult to find time to learn a new skill while working full-time job and I was trying to 
                        teach myself with little to no structure. I began reading about coding on codecademy and freecodecamp but whenever it came to 
                        actually applying my skills with hands-on practice, I did not know where to start. I am excited to learn more about programming and code more!
